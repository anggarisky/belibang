## Introduction to the Belibang Project

I am pleased to announce the completion of my foundational training in Laravel, Inertia, and React JS, culminating in the development of a sophisticated project named Belibang.

This project offers a comprehensive source code that facilitates the establishment of an online marketplace akin to Gumroad. It serves as a platform for individuals to purchase and sell digital products, including but not limited to ebooks, courses, and templates.

For further inquiries or interest in this project, please contact me via BuildWithAngga.

### Project Features:

-   Dual functionality allows users to register as either a buyer or a seller within the same account framework.
-   The Discover page presents a curated selection of products for purchase.
-   Sellers have the capability to authorize transactions, ensuring a secure and efficient sales process.
-   The implementation of a RateLimiter feature mitigates the risk of excessive downloads on the same product, enhancing platform stability.
-   A safeguard is in place to prevent sellers from purchasing their own products, maintaining the integrity of the marketplace.
-   Authentication processes are streamlined and secure, thanks to the integration of Laravel Breeze.
-   The combination of Inertia and React JS delivers an unparalleled user experience, characterized by seamless navigation and interaction.
